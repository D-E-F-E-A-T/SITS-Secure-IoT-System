#### SITS is a secure IoT system that implements lightweight cryptography which performs strong security mechanism, encryption or decryption with low power applications. Here we apply the lightweight cryptographic algorithms in order to achieve end-to-end security and with lower power consumption in these devices. These lightweight algorithms are designed for IoT to deal with the security and resource utilization challenges.

## ABSTRACT
The Internet of Things (IoT) being a promising technology of the future is expected to connect billions of devices. With the passage of time more and more devices like wearables, home automation devices, industrial automation devices are getting connected to the internet. The sophisticated chips and sensors that are embedded in these devices collect valuable data. These devices will create a huge and complex network where a massive amount of data is communicated throughout the network. This process of sharing such large amount of data begins with the devices themselves and this increases number of communications which generates mountains of data and the security of data can be a threat. To adopt the IoT technology it is necessary to build the confidence among the users about its security and privacy that it will not cause any threat to their data integrity, confidentiality and authority. 

There are many challenges and issues like power consumption of devices, limited battery, memory, space, performance cost hence IoT are not suitable for the implementation of computationally expensive encryption algorithms. Conventional encryption algorithms are generally computationally expensive due to their complexity and requires many rounds to encrypt, essentially wasting the constrained energy of the gadgets. Less complex algorithm, however, may compromise the desired integrity. Hence there is a requirement to adopt lightweight cryptography which performs strong security mechanism, encryption or decryption with low power applications and other functionalities for the pervasive computing. Here we apply the lightweight symmetry key algorithm in order to achieve end-to-end security and with lower power consumption in these devices. These lightweight algorithms are designed for IoT to deal with the security and resource utilization challenges. With so many applications eyeing to adapt the technology with the intentions to contribute in the growth of economy, healthcare facility, transportation and a better life style for the public, IoT must offer adequate security to their data to encourage the adaptation process. there is significant concern to provide security at the same time reducing the cryptographyâ€™s footprints by the use of lightweight cryptography.
